            <h1>Response One</h1>
            <p>
                Also... while revealing Jon's parentage wouldn't be politically wise by a long shot, I don't think it's as fraught as it might seem. There's this idea that Jon might be destined for the throne (or at least has a good shot at it) in the fandom because we're all familiar with fantasy stories with secret princes raised in humble origins who end up King. But none of the characters of ASOIAF know that they're in a book. From an in universe perspective, Jon isn't really a credible threat to Baratheon rule. There isn't really any active block of Targ restorationists in the Seven Kingdoms, nor any appetite for one. Doran secretly is but he's done so little about it that nobody besides him could possibly tell. And if there were, they'd pick Viserys or Dany as their choice to restore any day of the week and twice on Tuesdays.
            </p>
            <h2>Response Two</h2>
            <p>
