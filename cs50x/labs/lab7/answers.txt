For Spotify Wrapped, Characterization of the Aura for the listener:
SELECT AVG(energy),
   ...> AVG(danceability),
   ...> AVG(valence),
   ...> (AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) + AVG(danceability)) / 3 as aura
   ...> FROM songs;

How I would Characterize the Aura for a listener:
SELECT AVG(energy),
   ...> AVG(danceability),
   ...> AVG(valence),
   ...> AVG(tempo),
   ...> AVG(loudness),
   ...> AVG(speechiness),
   ...> (AVG(energy) + AVG(danceability) + AVG(valence) + AVG(tempo) + AVG(loudness) + AVG(speechiness)) / 5
   ...> AS audio_aura
   ...> FROM songs;

Only the 3 checked parameters might not be very representative of the viewers mood.
We have access to more parameters than that which should also be considered.
I do so in the above query.
